# rsync
Rsync is an open-source utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files between directories, local 
systems, or remote servers. It’s widely used for backups, mirroring, and data synchronization due to its speed, 
reliability, and flexibility. Rsync is available on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) and can be used on Windows 
with tools like Cygwin or WSL.

## What is Rsync?
Rsync (short for "remote sync") is a command-line tool that synchronizes files and directories from one location to 
another while minimizing data transfer by copying only the differences between the source and destination. It uses 
a delta-transfer algorithm to achieve this efficiency, making it ideal for large datasets or slow network connections.

## Key Features of Rsync
1. **Efficient Delta Transfer**: Only transfers changed portions of files, not entire files, reducing bandwidth and time.
2. **Preservation**: Maintains file permissions, timestamps, ownership, and symbolic links (with appropriate flags).
3. **Compression**: Supports compression during transfer to save bandwidth.
4. **Remote and Local Use**: Works for local-to-local, local-to-remote, or remote-to-remote file transfers.
5. **Incremental Backups**: Supports incremental backups with options to preserve older versions of files.
6. **Customizable**: Offers extensive options for filtering, excluding, and controlling the sync process.

### How Rsync Works
Rsync uses a combination of checks to determine which files or parts of files need to be transferred. Here’s a simplified explanation of its process:

1. **File List Comparison**:
   - Rsync builds a list of files and directories in the source and destination.
   - It compares metadata (e.g., file size, modification time) to identify differences.

2. **Delta-Transfer Algorithm**:
   - For files that differ, rsync splits them into fixed-size blocks (e.g., 700 bytes).
   - It calculates checksums (using algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1) for each block in the source and destination.
   - The destination sends its checksums to the source, which compares them to identify changed or new blocks.
   - Only the differing blocks are transferred, not the entire file.

3. **Transfer and Reconstruction**:
   - Rsync sends the changed blocks (or new files) over the network, often compressing the data.
   - The destination reconstructs the updated files using the transferred blocks and existing data.

4. **Metadata Preservation**:
   - Rsync applies the original file’s metadata (permissions, timestamps, etc.) to the destination files, ensuring consistency.

5. **Optional Features**:
   - Rsync can delete files in the destination that no longer exist in the source (with `--delete`).
   - It supports excluding specific files or directories (with `--exclude`).
   - It can operate over SSH for secure transfers or use its own daemon for direct connections.

### Basic Syntax
```bash
rsync [options] source destination
```

- **Source/Destination**: Can be local paths (e.g., `/home/user/dir/`) or remote (e.g., `user@host:/path/`).
- **Common Options**:
  - `-r`: Recursive, syncs directories and their contents.
  - `-a`: Archive mode, preserves permissions, timestamps, symbolic links, etc.
  - `-v`: Verbose, shows detailed output.
  - `-z`: Compresses data during transfer.
  - `--progress`: Shows transfer progress.
  - `--delete`: Deletes files in the destination that are absent in the source.
  - `--exclude`: Excludes specified files or patterns.
  - `-e`: Specifies the remote shell (e.g., `-e ssh` for SSH).

### Examples
1. **Local Sync**:
   ```bash
   rsync -av /home/user/documents/ /backup/documents/
   ```
   Copies the `documents` directory to `/backup/documents/`, preserving permissions and showing progress.

2. **Remote Sync (Push)**:
   ```bash
   rsync -avz -e ssh /home/user/documents/ user@remote:/home/user/backup/
   ```
   Copies `documents` to a remote server over SSH with compression.

3. **Remote Sync (Pull)**:
   ```bash
   rsync -avz -e ssh user@remote:/home/user/backup/ /home/user/documents/
   ```
   Pulls files from the remote server to the local machine.

4. **Exclude Files**:
   ```bash
   rsync -av --exclude '*.log' /home/user/dir/ /backup/dir/
   ```
   Syncs `dir` but excludes `.log` files.

5. **Mirror with Deletion**:
   ```bash
   rsync -av --delete /home/user/dir/ /backup/dir/
   ```
   Mirrors `dir` to `/backup/dir/`, deleting files in the destination that no longer exist in the source.

### How Rsync Optimizes Transfers
- **Rolling Checksum**: Rsync uses a rolling checksum algorithm to compare file blocks efficiently, even if data is shifted (e.g., insertions or deletions in a file).
- **Network Efficiency**: By transferring only changed blocks and optionally compressing data, rsync minimizes bandwidth usage.
- **Idempotency**: Running rsync multiple times produces the same result, making it safe for interrupted transfers.

### Use Cases
- **Backups**: Create incremental backups to save disk space and time.
- **Server Mirroring**: Sync web servers or databases across machines.
- **Data Migration**: Move large datasets between systems with minimal downtime.
- **File Sharing**: Distribute files across distributed teams or devices.

### Caveats
- **Trailing Slash Matters**: `rsync -av /src/dir /dst` copies the `dir` folder into `/dst`, while `rsync -av /src/dir/ /dst` copies the contents of `dir` into `/dst`.
- **Permissions**: Ensure proper user permissions for source and destination, especially for remote syncs.
- **SSH Keys**: For remote transfers, setting up SSH keys can avoid repeated password prompts.
- **Large Datasets**: For very large files or slow networks, consider `--progress` or `--partial` to handle interruptions.

### Advanced Usage
- **Rsync Daemon**: Run rsync as a server for direct connections without SSH.
- **Incremental Backups**: Use `--backup` and `--backup-dir` to store changed files in a separate directory.
- **Bandwidth Limits**: Use `--bwlimit` to cap transfer speed (e.g., `--bwlimit=1000` for 1MB/s).
- **Dry Run**: Use `--dry-run` to simulate the sync without making changes.
